Preparing files: - (Import Machine + (Network Adapters:- (Host Only Adapters + NAT Adapter + NAT Network Adapter + Internal Adapter) ) + Configure APT + Configure Network File + Install SSH Server + Install Man Command)

Perfect 👍 let’s keep it **super basic**.
We’ll just prepare a **Linux VM in VirtualBox** with **internet access**, **SSH**, and **man** pages — nothing advanced.

# 🛠️ Basic VM Configuration (Step by Step)

### 1. Import / Create VM

* In VirtualBox → **New** → Choose `Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)` → give it RAM, disk → attach ISO → install OS.

---

### 2. Network (only NAT adapter for now)

* VM Settings → **Network** → Adapter 1 = **NAT**.
  👉 NAT will give your VM internet through your host.

---

### 3. Boot VM & Update system

Inside the VM:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

### 4. Configure APT (basic)

Already set during install. If broken, edit:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Add (example Ubuntu):

```
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal main universe
```

Save → exit → `sudo apt update`.

---

### 5. Install SSH & Man

```bash
sudo apt install -y openssh-server man-db
```

Enable SSH:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now ssh
```

Check:

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

---

### 6. Test Networking

Check your IP:

```bash
ip a
```

Test internet:

```bash
ping -c 3 google.com
```

Test man:

```bash
man ls
```

---

👉 That’s it for **basic configuration**.

* NAT = internet works.
* SSH server installed.
* `man` pages installed.
