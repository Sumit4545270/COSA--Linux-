bro 👍 — let’s go through the **`wc` command** step by step.

---

# 🐧 `wc` Command in Linux

## 🔑 What is `wc`?

* `wc` = **word count**.
* It is used to count **lines, words, characters, and bytes** in a file or input.

---

## 📌 Syntax

```bash
wc [OPTION] [FILE...]
```

---

## 📌 Examples

### 1. Count everything (default)

```bash
wc file.txt
```

👉 Output looks like:

```
  15   120   850 file.txt
```

* **15** → number of lines
* **120** → number of words
* **850** → number of characters (bytes)

---

### 2. Count only lines (`-l`)

```bash
wc -l file.txt
```

👉 Example output:

```
15 file.txt
```

---

### 3. Count only words (`-w`)

```bash
wc -w file.txt
```

👉 Example output:

```
120 file.txt
```

---

### 4. Count only characters (`-m`)

```bash
wc -m file.txt
```

👉 Example output:

```
850 file.txt
```

---

### 5. Count only bytes (`-c`)

```bash
wc -c file.txt
```

👉 Example output:

```
850 file.txt
```

(`-c` and `-m` can differ if file has Unicode characters).

---

### 6. Multiple files

```bash
wc file1.txt file2.txt
```

👉 Gives counts for each file + total.

---

### 7. Use with pipes

```bash
ls | wc -l
```

👉 Counts how many files are in current directory.

## 📌 Common Options

| Option | Meaning          | Example          |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `-l`   | Count lines      | `wc -l file.txt` |
| `-w`   | Count words      | `wc -w file.txt` |
| `-m`   | Count characters | `wc -m file.txt` |
| `-c`   | Count bytes      | `wc -c file.txt` |

---

## 🧠 Analogy

Think of `wc` like a **page counter 📑**:

* It tells you how many lines, words, and letters are inside your file — just like how Word/MS Office shows counts at the bottom.
