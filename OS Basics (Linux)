# 🐧 **Linux Basics (Interview-Friendly Explanation)**

---

## 1️⃣ What is Linux?

* Linux is an **Operating System (OS)** just like Windows or macOS.
* But the difference → Linux is **open-source** (free, anyone can use or modify).
* It is mostly **command-based**, which makes it powerful and flexible.
* Used in **servers, networking, programming, cybersecurity, and cloud computing**.

👉 In interview, say: *“Linux is an open-source operating system widely used in servers and IT infrastructure because of its stability, security, and flexibility.”*

---

## 2️⃣ Linux Architecture (How Linux Works)

1. **Kernel** → The brain/heart → controls CPU, RAM, Disk, Network.
2. **Shell** → Translator between user and Kernel (where we type commands).
3. **Commands/Utilities** → Tools (like `ls`, `cd`, `cp`).
4. **Applications** → Software running on Linux.

👉 Interview Tip: *“The Kernel controls hardware, the Shell takes commands, and Utilities/Applications run on top.”*

---

## 3️⃣ Linux File System (Hierarchy)

* Everything in Linux is a **file** (even devices like USB, Printer).
* Starts from **root `/`** directory (like C:\ in Windows).

Important directories:

* `/home` → User files
* `/etc` → Configuration files
* `/bin` → Basic commands
* `/var` → Logs and temporary data
* `/root` → Admin user’s home directory

👉 Interview Tip: *“Linux uses a single root `/` directory structure unlike Windows which uses C:, D: drives.”*

---

## 4️⃣ Users in Linux

* **Root user** → Super admin (full control).
* **Normal user** → Limited access.

👉 Example: *Root = Boss, Normal user = Employee*.

---

## 5️⃣ Common Linux Commands

* `pwd` → Show where I am (Print Working Directory).
* `ls` → List files/folders.
* `cd folder` → Go inside a folder.
* `touch file.txt` → Create a file.
* `cat file.txt` → View file contents.
* `cp` / `mv` / `rm` → Copy, move, delete files.
* `mkdir` / `rmdir` → Create/remove directories.
* `whoami` → Shows current user.

👉 Interview Tip: *“I am comfortable with basic Linux commands for file management, navigation, and system monitoring.”*

---

## 6️⃣ File Permissions

* **3 types**: Read (r), Write (w), Execute (x).
* **3 groups**: Owner, Group, Others.

Example:

```
-rwxr-xr--
```

* Owner = rwx (full)
* Group = r-x (read+execute)
* Others = r-- (only read)

👉 Interview Tip: *“Linux controls security using permissions (read, write, execute) for Owner, Group, and Others.”*

---

## 7️⃣ Process Management

* **Process = running program**.
* `ps` → list processes.
* `top` → live monitoring (like Task Manager).
* `kill <pid>` → stop process.

---

## 8️⃣ Package Management (Installing software)

* Ubuntu/Debian → `apt install package-name`
* RedHat/CentOS → `yum install package-name` or `dnf install`

👉 Interview Tip: *“Linux distributions use package managers like apt or yum to install software.”*

---

## 9️⃣ Networking in Linux

* `ifconfig` / `ip a` → Check IP address.
* `ping google.com` → Test connectivity.
* `ssh user@ip` → Remote login into another system.

---

## 🔟 Why Linux is Important?

* Runs **90% of servers** worldwide.
* Used in **DevOps, Networking, Cloud, and Cybersecurity**.
* More **secure and stable** than Windows.

👉 Interview Tip: *“Linux is widely used in IT because it is reliable, secure, scalable, and open-source.”*

# 🎯 Final One-Line Summary

Linux = **An open-source OS where everything is a file, controlled via commands, with strong security (permissions) and widely used in servers and IT industries.**
