bro 👍 — now let’s dive into **`head`** and **`tail`** commands. These two are like opposite brothers in Linux 😅.

---

# 🐧 `head` Command in Linux

## 🔑 What is `head`?

* `head` shows the **first lines** of a file.
* Default = first **10 lines**.

---

## 📌 Syntax

```bash
head [OPTIONS] [FILE...]
```

---

## 📌 Examples

### 1. Show first 10 lines

```bash
head file.txt
```

### 2. Show first N lines (`-n`)

```bash
head -n 5 file.txt
```

👉 Shows top 5 lines.

### 3. Show first N bytes (`-c`)

```bash
head -c 20 file.txt
```

👉 Shows first 20 characters.

### 4. Multiple files

```bash
head file1.txt file2.txt
```

👉 Prints first 10 lines of each file.

# 🐧 `tail` Command in Linux

## 🔑 What is `tail`?

* `tail` shows the **last lines** of a file.
* Default = last **10 lines**.

---

## 📌 Syntax

```bash
tail [OPTIONS] [FILE...]
```

---

## 📌 Examples

### 1. Show last 10 lines

```bash
tail file.txt
```

### 2. Show last N lines (`-n`)

```bash
tail -n 5 file.txt
```

👉 Shows bottom 5 lines.

### 3. Show last N bytes (`-c`)

```bash
tail -c 20 file.txt
```

👉 Shows last 20 characters.

### 4. Follow a file in real-time (`-f`) 🔥

```bash
tail -f logfile.log
```

👉 Keeps showing new lines as they are added (super useful for monitoring logs).

### 5. Multiple files

```bash
tail file1.txt file2.txt
```

# 📌 `head` vs `tail`

| Feature      | `head`                    | `tail`                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Default      | First 10 lines            | Last 10 lines            |
| Custom lines | `head -n N`               | `tail -n N`              |
| Custom bytes | `head -c N`               | `tail -c N`              |
| Special use  | Preview beginning of file | Monitor logs (`tail -f`) |

## 🧠 Analogy

* **`head`** = Reading the **first pages of a book 📖**.
* **`tail`** = Jumping to the **last pages of a book 🔚**.
