Nice one bro 👍 The **`clear` command** is probably the easiest of all, but very handy.

# 🐧 `clear` Command in Linux

## 🔑 What is `clear`?

* `clear` is used to **clear the terminal screen**.
* It removes all previous commands/output from view and gives you a fresh screen.
* But 👉 it doesn’t delete anything; your commands are still in **history**.

---

## 📌 Syntax

```bash
clear
```

---

## 📌 Examples

### 1. Basic use

```bash
clear
```

👉 Terminal becomes empty (clean screen).

---

### 2. Shortcut key (same as `clear`)

Press:

```
Ctrl + L
```

👉 Does the same thing as `clear`.

---

### 3. Clear but keep scrollback buffer (history still scrollable)

```bash
clear
```

👉 You can still scroll up to see old output.

---

### 4. Clear *everything* (including scrollback buffer)

```bash
clear && printf '\033c'
```

👉 Resets the terminal completely like reopening it.

## 🧠 Analogy

Think of `clear` like **wiping a whiteboard 🧽**.

* The old writing (commands) are gone from sight.
* But you still “remember” them in your notes (command history).
