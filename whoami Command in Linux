Nice pick bro 👍 Let’s clear the **`whoami` command** in Linux.

# 🐧 `whoami` Command in Linux

## 🔑 What is `whoami`?

* `whoami` = **Who Am I**
* It shows the **username of the current user** who is logged into the system.

👉 Simple but very useful for knowing **which account you are using** (especially when switching users with `su` or `sudo`).

---

## 📌 Syntax

```bash
whoami
```

---

## 📌 Example

### 1. Basic usage

```bash
whoami
```

👉 Output:

```
sumit
```

(If your username is `sumit`.)

---

### 2. Inside `sudo`

```bash
sudo whoami
```

👉 Output:

```
root
```

(Because you temporarily became the root user using `sudo`.)

---

## 📌 Difference with `who` command

* `whoami` → shows **current username only**.
* `who` → shows **all logged-in users**.

Example:

```bash
who
```

👉 Output:

```
sumit   tty1   Sep 10 09:15
rahul   pts/0  Sep 10 09:30 (:0)
```

---

## 🧠 Analogy

Think of `whoami` like **looking in the mirror 🪞** and asking:
*"Which user am I right now?"*
