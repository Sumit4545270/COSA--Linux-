Nice flow bro 👍 Let’s go deep into the **`hostname` command** in Linux — very commonly asked in interviews too.

# 🐧 `hostname` Command in Linux

## 🔑 What is `hostname`?

* The **hostname** is the **name of your computer (system)** on a network.
* The `hostname` command is used to **display or set** that name.

👉 Think of it like your computer’s nickname when connected to Wi-Fi or LAN.

---

## 📌 Syntax

```bash
hostname [OPTION]
```

---

## 📌 Basic Examples

### 1. Show current hostname

```bash
hostname
```

👉 Output:

```
sumit-PC
```

---

### 2. Show the IP address (`-i`)

```bash
hostname -i
```

👉 Output:

```
192.168.1.10
```

---

### 3. Show the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) (`-f`)

```bash
hostname -f
```

👉 Output:

```
sumit.example.com
```

---

### 4. Show all network addresses (`-I`)

```bash
hostname -I
```

👉 Output:

```
192.168.1.10 10.0.0.5
```

(Multiple addresses if multiple network interfaces are active.)

---

### 5. Show alias names (`-A`)

```bash
hostname -A
```

---

### 6. Set a new hostname (temporary)

```bash
sudo hostname myserver
```

👉 Hostname will change to `myserver` (but only until restart).

---

### 7. Set hostname permanently

* Edit file:

  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/hostname
  ```

  Replace old name with new one.
* Then update:

  ```bash
  sudo hostnamectl set-hostname myserver
  ```

## 📌 Common Options Cheat Sheet

| Option | Meaning          | Example       |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| none   | Show hostname    | `hostname`    |
| `-i`   | Show IP address  | `hostname -i` |
| `-I`   | Show all IPs     | `hostname -I` |
| `-f`   | Show FQDN        | `hostname -f` |
| `-A`   | Show alias names | `hostname -A` |

## 🧠 Analogy

Think of `hostname` as your **house name in a colony** 🏠:

* Everyone on the network (neighbors) identifies you with that name.
* You can change the name, but then people may need to update how they reach you.
