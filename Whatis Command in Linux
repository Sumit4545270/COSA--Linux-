Good pick bro 👍 The **`whatis` command** is another simple but very handy Linux command. Let’s break it down.

# 🐧 `whatis` Command in Linux

## 🔑 What is `whatis`?

* `whatis` gives you a **one-line description** of a Linux command.
* It’s like asking: *“Hey Linux, what does this command do?”*

---

## 📌 Syntax

```bash
whatis command_name
```

---

## 📌 Examples

### 1. Basic usage

```bash
whatis ls
```

👉 Output:

```
ls (1) - list directory contents
```

---

### 2. Another command

```bash
whatis mkdir
```

👉 Output:

```
mkdir (1) - make directories
```

---

### 3. Multiple commands at once

```bash
whatis ls mkdir grep
```

👉 Output:

```
ls (1)    - list directory contents
mkdir (1) - make directories
grep (1)  - print lines matching a pattern
```

### 4. Command not found in database

Sometimes you may see:

```
whatis: somecommand: nothing appropriate
```

👉 This means the `man` database is not updated.
Fix by updating:

```bash
sudo mandb
```

## 📌 Why use `whatis`?

* Quick reminder of what a command does.
* Saves time if you forget a command’s purpose.

## 🧠 Analogy

Think of `whatis` like **Google’s snippet**:
You search “ls” → it tells you in one line what it does, without reading the whole manual.
