# 🐧 `reboot` Command in Linux

## 🔑 What is `reboot`?

* The `reboot` command **restarts the system** immediately.
* Equivalent to pressing **Ctrl+Alt+Del** or restarting your computer.
* Needs **root privileges**, so usually run with `sudo`.

---

## 📌 Syntax

```bash
reboot [OPTIONS]
```

---

## 📌 Examples

### 1. Basic restart

```bash
sudo reboot
```

👉 Immediately restarts the system.

---

### 2. Force reboot (`-f`) ⚠️

```bash
sudo reboot -f
```

👉 Forces a restart **without shutting down services cleanly** → risky if unsaved work.

---

### 3. Reboot with scheduling

Linux prefers `shutdown` for scheduling:

```bash
sudo shutdown -r +10
```

👉 Restarts system in 10 minutes.

---

### 4. Reboot with message

```bash
sudo shutdown -r now "System will reboot for updates"
```

👉 Sends message to all logged-in users before restarting.
