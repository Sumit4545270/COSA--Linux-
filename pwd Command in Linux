Perfect bro 👍 Let’s nail the **`pwd` command** — one of the simplest but most important Linux commands.

# 🐧 `pwd` Command in Linux

## 🔑 What is `pwd`?

* `pwd` = **Print Working Directory**
* It shows the **full path of the folder (directory)** you are currently in.

👉 Because in Linux you often move around folders using commands like `cd`, and `pwd` tells you *“where am I right now?”*

---

## 📌 Syntax

```bash
pwd [OPTION]
```

---

## 📌 Basic Example

### 1. Just show current directory

```bash
pwd
```

👉 Output:

```
/home/sumit/Documents
```

(This means you’re inside the `Documents` folder of user `sumit`.)

---

## 📌 Options

### 2. Show logical path (`-L`)

```bash
pwd -L
```

👉 Shows the path with symbolic links (default).

### 3. Show physical path (`-P`)

```bash
pwd -P
```

👉 Shows the actual directory, resolving symlinks.

Example:
If `/home/sumit/shortcut` is a **symlink** to `/mnt/data`, then:

* `pwd -L` → `/home/sumit/shortcut`
* `pwd -P` → `/mnt/data`

---

## 📌 When is `pwd` useful?

* When you are lost after many `cd` commands.
* When writing scripts that depend on your current path.
* When handling symlinks.

## 🧠 Analogy

Think of `pwd` like **Google Maps "You Are Here 📍"** — it tells you your exact location in the Linux filesystem.
