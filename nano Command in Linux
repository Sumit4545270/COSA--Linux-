# 🐧 `nano` Command in Linux

## 🔑 What is `nano`?

* `nano` is a **command-line text editor**.
* You can use it to **create, edit, and save files** directly in the terminal.
* Easier than `vi` or `vim`, so it’s beginner-friendly.

## 📌 Syntax

```bash
nano [OPTIONS] [FILENAME]
```

---

## 📌 Examples

### 1. Open (or create) a file

```bash
nano myfile.txt
```

👉 Opens `myfile.txt`. If it doesn’t exist, it creates it.

---

### 2. Open a file in **read-only** mode

```bash
nano -v myfile.txt
```

👉 You can view but not edit.

---

### 3. Open multiple files

```bash
nano file1.txt file2.txt
```

👉 Switch between them using **Ctrl+^**.
