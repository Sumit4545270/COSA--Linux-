let’s make the **`sort` command** super simple and useful for you.

# 🐧 `sort` Command in Linux

## 🔑 What is `sort`?

The **`sort` command** is used to **arrange lines of text** in a file or output.
It can sort:

* Alphabetically (A → Z, Z → A)
* Numerically (1 → 9, 9 → 1)
* By column (field)
* With or without case sensitivity

---

## 📌 Basic Syntax

```bash
sort [OPTIONS] [FILE]
```

---

## 📌 Basic Examples

### 1. Sort a file alphabetically (A → Z)

```bash
sort names.txt
```

### 2. Sort in reverse order (Z → A)

```bash
sort -r names.txt
```

### 3. Sort numbers correctly

```bash
sort -n numbers.txt
```

👉 Without `-n`, `sort` treats numbers like text (`10` comes before `2`).
👉 With `-n`, it sorts properly (`2, 10, 20`).

### 4. Sort numbers in descending order

```bash
sort -nr numbers.txt
```

### 5. Remove duplicates while sorting

```bash
sort -u names.txt
```

### 6. Sort by a specific column

Imagine a file `students.txt`:

```
Sumit 88
Rahul 75
Amit 92
```

Sort by **second column (marks):**

```bash
sort -k2 -n students.txt
```

👉 Sorted by marks.

### 7. Case insensitive sorting

```bash
sort -f names.txt
```

### 8. Sort month names

```bash
sort -M months.txt
```

👉 Correctly sorts Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.

| Option | Meaning                    | Example                |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `-r`   | Reverse order              | `sort -r file.txt`     |
| `-n`   | Numeric sort               | `sort -n numbers.txt`  |
| `-u`   | Unique (remove duplicates) | `sort -u file.txt`     |
| `-k`   | Sort by specific column    | `sort -k2 -n file.txt` |
| `-f`   | Ignore case                | `sort -f file.txt`     |
| `-M`   | Sort by month names        | `sort -M months.txt`   |

## 📌 Example with Pipe (`|`)

```bash
cat marks.txt | sort -k2 -n
```

👉 Sorts the contents of `marks.txt` by the second column (marks).

---

## 🧠 Analogy

Think of `sort` like arranging your **contact list**:

* A → Z (default)
* Z → A (`-r`)
* By phone number (`-n -k2`)
* Without duplicate names (`-u`)
