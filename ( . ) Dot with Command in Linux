# 🐧 Meaning of `.` (dot) in Linux

### 1. Current Directory

```bash
ls .
```

👉 Lists files in the **current directory**.
(`.` = the folder you are currently in)

---

### 2. Parent Directory (`..`)

```bash
ls ..
```

👉 Lists files in the **parent folder** (one step back).

---

### 3. Run a Script in Current Shell

```bash
. script.sh
```

👉 Executes `script.sh` **in the current shell** (different from `./script.sh`, which runs in a new process).

---

### 4. Hidden Files

Any file/folder starting with `.` is **hidden**.
Example:

* `.bashrc` → hidden file.
* `.git/` → hidden folder.

To see hidden files:

```bash
ls -a
```

---

### 5. Path Usage

```bash
./program
```

👉 Run `program` in the current directory.
(`./` means "look here, not in system folders").

---

## 🧠 Analogy

* `.` = **this room** (current directory)
* `..` = **go to the previous room (parent folder)**
* `./file` = “use the file from this room”
