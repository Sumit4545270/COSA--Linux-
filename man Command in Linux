# 🐧 `man` Command in Linux

## 🔑 What is `man`?

* `man` = **manual**.
* It shows the **documentation (manual pages)** of any Linux command.
* These manuals contain:

  * Command description
  * Syntax
  * Options/flags (`-a`, `-l`, etc.)
  * Examples
  * Related commands

👉 So whenever you’re confused about a command, just use `man`.

---

## 📌 Syntax

```bash
man [OPTION] COMMAND
```

---

## 📌 Examples

### 1. Open manual for a command

```bash
man ls
```

👉 Shows the full manual for `ls`.

---

### 2. Go to a specific section

Linux manual pages are divided into **sections**:

| Section | Contains                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1       | User commands (e.g. `ls`, `cp`) |
| 2       | System calls                    |
| 3       | Library functions               |
| 4       | Special files                   |
| 5       | File formats                    |
| 6       | Games 😁                        |
| 7       | Misc                            |
| 8       | System admin commands           |

Example:

```bash
man 5 passwd
```

👉 Opens section 5 (file format) for `/etc/passwd`.

---

### 3. Search for a keyword in man pages

```bash
man -k keyword
```

👉 Example:

```bash
man -k copy
```

Shows all commands related to "copy" (like `cp`, `scp`).

---

### 4. Quit the manual

Press:

```
q
```

👉 Exits the man page.

---

### 5. Navigate inside man page

* **↑ ↓** → Move up/down
* **Spacebar** → Page down
* **b** → Page up
* **q** → Quit
* **/** → Search inside page

## 📌 Common Options

| Option   | Meaning                              | Example         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| none     | Open manual                          | `man ls`        |
| `-k`     | Search by keyword                    | `man -k disk`   |
| `-f`     | Short description (same as `whatis`) | `man -f ls`     |
| `-a`     | Show all man pages for a command     | `man -a printf` |
| `number` | Open a specific section              | `man 2 open`    |

## 🧠 Analogy

Think of `man` as your **instruction manual** for Linux 🛠️.
Whenever you buy a new gadget, you check the manual for how to use it → same here for commands.
