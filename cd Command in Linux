bro 👍 — now let’s cover the **`cd` command**, which is one of the **most basic and important Linux commands**.

# 🐧 `cd` Command in Linux

## 🔑 What is `cd`?

* `cd` = **change directory**
* It is used to **move between folders** in Linux.
* Linux has a hierarchical file system, so you often need to navigate directories using `cd`.

---

## 📌 Syntax

```bash
cd [DIRECTORY]
```

---

## 📌 Examples

### 1. Go to a specific directory

```bash
cd /home/sumit/Documents
```

👉 Moves you to the `Documents` folder.

---

### 2. Go to home directory

```bash
cd
```

or

```bash
cd ~
```

👉 `~` = shorthand for your home directory (`/home/username`).

---

### 3. Go to parent directory

```bash
cd ..
```

👉 Moves one level **up** in the directory tree.

---

### 4. Go back to previous directory

```bash
cd -
```

👉 Moves to the directory you were in **just before** the current one.

---

### 5. Relative paths

```bash
cd Projects/Java
```

* Moves to `Java` folder inside `Projects` from **current directory**.

---

### 6. Absolute paths

```bash
cd /var/log
```

* Moves to `/var/log` regardless of current location.

---

## 📌 Tips

* `pwd` → Use it to check your **current directory** after moving.
* Tab completion → Press **Tab** while typing a folder name for **auto-completion**.

---

## 🧠 Analogy

Think of the Linux filesystem like a **house with rooms 🏠**:

* `cd Kitchen` → move into the kitchen
* `cd ..` → go back to the previous room
* `cd ~` → go to your bedroom (home directory)
* `cd -` → go back to the last room you were in

---

This is super foundational because **every file operation** depends on **knowing where you are** and navigating correctly.
