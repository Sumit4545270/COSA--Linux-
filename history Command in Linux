Perfect bro 👍 now we’re at a very important command: **`history`**.

---

# 🐧 `history` Command in Linux

## 🔑 What is `history`?

* The `history` command shows you a **list of all commands** you typed earlier in the terminal.
* Each command is stored with a **number (ID)** so you can reuse it quickly.

👉 So even if you `clear` the screen, you can bring back old commands with `history`.

---

## 📌 Syntax

```bash
history [OPTIONS] [NUMBER]
```

---

## 📌 Examples

### 1. Show entire command history

```bash
history
```

👉 Output looks like:

```
  1  ls
  2  cd Documents
  3  mkdir project
  4  history
```

---

### 2. Show last N commands

```bash
history 5
```

👉 Shows last 5 commands only.

---

### 3. Re-run a command using `!`

If a command has a history number, you can repeat it using `!number`.

Example:

```bash
!3
```

👉 Runs command number 3 from history (`mkdir project`).

---

### 4. Re-run last command

```bash
!!
```

👉 Runs the last command again.

---

### 5. Re-run last command starting with a word

```bash
!ls
```

👉 Runs the last command that started with `ls`.

---

### 6. Clear history

```bash
history -c
```

👉 Clears the history of the **current session**.

---

### 7. Save history to file

```bash
history -w
```

👉 Writes current session history to the history file (`~/.bash_history`).
