bro 👍 — **`su`** and **`sudo`** are two of the **most important Linux commands** when it comes to user switching and permissions. Let’s make it super clear.

---

# 🐧 `su` vs `sudo` in Linux

## 🔑 1. `su` → **Switch User**

* **`su`** = *substitute user* or *switch user*.
* By default, it switches to the **root user** (superuser).
* After switching, you’re permanently acting as that user until you exit.

### 📌 Syntax

```bash
su [username]
```

### 📌 Examples

1. Switch to root:

```bash
su
```

👉 It will ask for **root password**, then you become root.

2. Switch to another user:

```bash
su rahul
```

👉 Switch to user `rahul`.

3. Exit back to your user:

```bash
exit
```

## 🔑 2. `sudo` → **Superuser Do**

* **`sudo`** = *superuser do*.
* Runs **a single command** with **admin/root privileges**.
* You don’t switch permanently; only that command runs as root.
* Uses **your password**, not root’s (if your user has sudo rights).

### 📌 Syntax

```bash
sudo command
```

### 📌 Examples

1. Run update as root:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

2. Edit a system file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

3. Run command as another user:

```bash
sudo -u rahul whoami
```

## 📌 Key Differences Between `su` and `sudo`

| Feature         | `su`                                     | `sudo`                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Full form       | Switch User                              | Superuser Do                                      |
| Default action  | Switch to root user                      | Run one command as root                           |
| Password needed | Root password                            | Your own password                                 |
| Duration        | Permanent (until `exit`)                 | Temporary (per command)                           |
| Security        | Less secure (needs root password shared) | More secure (per-user control via `/etc/sudoers`) |

---

## 📌 Advanced Notes

* `sudo su` → First use `sudo` (your password), then switch to `su` (root permanently).
* Config file for `sudo` is:

```bash
/etc/sudoers
```

(edited safely with `visudo`).

---

## 🧠 Analogy

* **`su`** = You **become the admin** and stay admin until you step down.
* **`sudo`** = You **borrow the admin’s key 🔑** just for one action, then return it.
